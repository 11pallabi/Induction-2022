**Enigma - The Web & Coding Club** welcomes all freshers to Induction 2022 and we hope that you all are excited and ready to learn new stuff, and eventually get inducted into the club.

Here at Enigma, we have always given more emphasis on knowledge transfer and that is how we would start your Enigma journey too ðŸ˜Ž

Enigma inductions are not primarily exams. They consist of 3 stages:

1. **Knowledge Transfer**
> We will be having Knowledge Transfer workshops on Open Source, Web Development, Python, and Competitive Programming according to the schedule that will be provided to you.


2. **Assessment**
> You would have to submit tasks provided after workshops in the respective domains which will be assessed.


3. **Personal Interview**
> Selected candidates from the previous two stages will advance to the next stage, i.e., a Personal Interview.


__N.B.: All the tasks will have their own deadlines__
